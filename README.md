<h2>This repository contains my coding practice of frontend in React framework.</h2>

[01 File Explorer](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/01%20file%20explorer) - It is the folder structure display just like vscode. One can add file or folder into the structure.
<br/>
[02 Pagination](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/02%20pagination) - It is the implementation of pagination into a website.
<br/>
[03 Password Generator](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/03%20password%20generator) - It helps in generating random passwords.
<br/>
[04 Progress Bar](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/04%20progress%20bar) - It is a progress bar with accessibility and scalability(can accommodate new functionality).
<br/>
[05 Grid Lights](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/05%20grid%20lights) - It is a game in which one can click on the cell to change its background color. Once all the cells are filled with green then they will be white again in reverse order of clicking.
<br/>
[06 LRU Cache](https://github.com/KhushiiVora/FrontendPractice/tree/main/src/components/06%20LRU%20cache) - It is the simulation of LRU(Least Recently Used) cache. When one clicks on one of the tabs, if data doesn't exist in cache then it will get loaded & rendered(takes 1 second delay) and will be stored into the LRU cache else data is fetched from the cache(causing no delay).
